================
CGI programming using the Perl "CGI.pm" module, data manipulation and back-end database support. 
Implemented the long distance toll and user personal information and add database connectivity to make it like a true Web application.
The basic idea of project is to allow a general user to log in, check the toll rates and calculate the charge of a call
time. If the user is the administrator, he/she will have priorities to update any record.
